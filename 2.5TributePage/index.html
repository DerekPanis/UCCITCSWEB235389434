      <h2>About Jasper</h2>
      <p>
        Jasper wasn’t just any cat — he was royalty wrapped in fur. Born in 2019, he soon earned a reputation for his majestic presence, boundless curiosity, and remarkable talent for discovering the coziest spots in the house. Whether he was darting after laser lights, insisting on chin scratches, or gazing thoughtfully out the window, Jasper had a way of turning every moment into something special.
      </p>
      <p>
        His favorite foods were tuna treats and anything stolen off the counter. Jasper 
        loved curling up in laundry baskets, watching birds from the windowsill, and meowing 
        loudly during Google meets to make sure he got attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though Jasper has crossed the bridge, his purrs still echo in the hearts 
        of everyone who loved him.
